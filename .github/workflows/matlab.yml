# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "run-matlab-tests"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up MATLAB on the runner
      - name: Set up MATLAB
        uses: matlab-actions/setup-matlab@v2
        with:
          # You can specify a specific MATLAB version here, e.g., 'R2023b'
          # 'latest' will use the newest version available on the action
          release: latest 

      # 3. Runs the MATLAB tests using the dedicated action for testing
      - name: Run MATLAB tests
        uses: matlab-actions/run-tests@v2
        with:
          # This will automatically find and run tests like 'testSolveQuadratic.m'
